My academic and professional journey are proof that I am always on the move. At the age of 16, I did my first exchange program to Argentina, where I studied for six months. At 17, I had to move to the capital to continue my studies. I studied business administration for seven years (three years of high school and four years of college at UFPB) and worked in the field for three.

Recently, at the age of 23, I made a career transition by taking a full-stack web development course at Labenu. Now I work as a professional Front End Jr developer, using React JS, Figma, GitHub, Jira, Typescript, REST API, React Hooks, and various modern libraries that make my work possible.

Despite already working as a developer, I haven't stopped learning. I'm still taking courses in PHP, JQUERY, and other bootcamps on free online platforms such as InnovationOne, which help me to practice back-end development.
